To start project you must firstly install **node.js** and then install globally next packages:
  - gulp-cli (`npm install gulp-cli -g`)

Next step: You need to install dependencies from package.json (`npm i`)

Everything is prepared. To start work just run in your CLI `npm start` and open your default browser.
If browser not opened automatically, just open in browser `http://localhost:3000/`
